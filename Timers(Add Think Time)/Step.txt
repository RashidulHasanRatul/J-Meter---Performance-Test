Purpose - to pause thread (v.user) for some time
   - to add delay between threads
   - to avoid over flooding the server and achieve real time          behaviour by pacing the load

 (to simulate v. user’s THINK TIME)

Constant Timer
Uniform Random Timer

Random Delay Max
Constant Delay Offset

formula:
0.X * Random Delay Max + Constant Delay Offset

X : 0-9

example:
0.X * 100 + 0

0 - 99 milli sec
